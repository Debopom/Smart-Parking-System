# Smart-Parking-System
A. Features
Below we are going to discuss about the features the system
will have,

1) Monitor observation: In every row of the parking slot
there will be a monitor to see which slots are available
to park the bike and slots will be separated by barricades.
If a slot is available for parking then, the monitor will
show green light for the specific slots and red light for
the occupied slots. In this way, we can ensure more
convenience for the users and also save the time of
checking slots.

2) Bike security: In every barricade there will be a scanner
and each user will have their own parking card allocated.
The users will use the parking card to lock and unlock
their vehicle/bike. For three wrong attempts, the scanner
will halt for five seconds. Moreover, if an exception
occurs and the door gets locked or any other issue arises
regarding the lock system,there will be a master card
available to the main authority to resolve the issue.
In addition, if any suspicious activities takes place,
subsequently,there be an alert.

3) Helmet security: A hook will be connected in the barricade and another one will be connected to the security
door which will be closed when the door closes with
the scanning system. Hence the biker does not need to
carry the helmet. And it will be safe until the door is
locked.

4) Sunlight and Rain protection: If there is excessive sunlight exposure, the system will open up a shade to cover
the whole area for sunlight protection. Likewise, if rain
starts then the area will also be covered up with the shade by detecting water.The shade will be retractable
in the designed system. In addition,the shade can also be operated manually.

5) Water storing: As the parking space will be covered with
the shade when there is rainfall,hence the shade will also
allow to store the rain water in an underground tank.
After that the water will be distributed to clean the area
or other water required purposes.

B. Component List
These are the component list we used in our project:
1) Arduino uno R-3: The Arduino UNO R3 is the perfect
board to get familiar with electronics and coding. This
versatile microcontroller is equipped with the wellknown ATmega328P and the ATMega 16U2 Processor.
This board will give you a great first experience within
the world of Arduino.

2) Arduino nano: The Arduino Nano is Arduino’s classic
breadboard friendly designed board with the smallest
dimensions.The Arduino Nano comes with pin headers
that allow for an easy attachment onto a breadboard and
features a Mini-B USB connector.

3) SG-90 servo motor: Tiny and lightweight with high
output power. Servo can rotate approximately 180 degrees,90 in each direction and works just like the standard kinds but smaller. We can use any servo code,
hardware or library to control these servos. It comes
with a 3 horns and hardware.

4) Rain sensor: The rain sensor module is an easy tool
for rain detection. It can be used as a switch when
raindrop falls through the raining board and also for
measuring rainfall intensity. The module features, a rain
board and the control board, power indicator LED and an
adjustable sensitivity though a potentiometer. The analog
output is used in detection of drops in the amount of
rainfall.
ADC = analogvoltagevalue × 1023

5) LDR module: LDR sensor module is a low-cost digital
sensor as well as analog sensor module, which is capable
to measure and detect light intensity. This sensor has an
onboard LDR(Light Dependent Resistor), that helps it to
detect light. This sensor module comes with 4 terminals.
Where the “DO” pin is a digital output pin and the “AO”
pin is an analog output pin. The output of the module
goes high in the absence of light and it becomes low in
the presence of light. The sensitivity of the sensor can
be adjusted using the onboard potentiometer.
V a0 = 5 × R1/R1 + R2

6) Ultrasound sensor: The Ultrasonic HC-SR04 Sensor
Module is a very popular sensor. Ultrasonic sensors
work by emitting high-frequency sound waves, that is
not heard by humans. It sends out a high-frequency
sound pulse from the transmitter and then the receiver
receives this sound when it reflects back from any object
surface. This way the sensors detect objects. It can
measure distance or detect objects in the range of 2cm400cm.
Distance =
T ime × SpeedOfSound/2


7) RFID sensor RC522: The MFRC522 is a highly integrated reader/writer IC for contactless communication. The MFRC522’s internal transmitter is able to
drive reader/writer antenna designed to communicate
with ISO/IEC 14443 A/MIFARE cards and transponders without additional active circuitry. The receiver
module provides a robust and efficient implementation
for demodulating and decoding signals from ISO/IEC
14443 A/MIFARE compatible cards and transponders.
The digital module manages the complete ISO/IEC
14443 A framing and error detection (parity and CRC)
functionality.
